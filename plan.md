Portfolio Website Implementation Plan
Goal Description
Create a personal portfolio website for a university student focused on Game Development and UI/UX Design. The site will feature a modern, dark-themed aesthetic with glassmorphism and animations.

User Review Required
NOTE

I will be using standard HTML/CSS/JS to ensure maximum control over aesthetics. The design will use a dark theme with vibrant accents suitable for a game developer.
